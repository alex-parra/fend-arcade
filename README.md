## How to Play
I took a different approach to the game play. I chose not to include GEMs and make the game a time challenge.
- You use the arrow keys to move the player;
- If you keep still on the GRASS, you lose health;
- If you go too far left or right (offscreen) you lose health;
- If you go in the water, you lose health;
- If you "fall of the grass below", you lose health;
- SO, you need to be on the road, dodging BUGS.
- Each level has a "on-the-road" time target to be reached;
- When you level up, you get a few health points;
